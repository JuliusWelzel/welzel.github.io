## What I Do

I am a Cognitive Neuroscientist with strong intrest in movement.

:::

My research in systematic neuroscience focuses on developing novel methods to better understand and treat movement disorders.
In particular, I am interested in the approachs to data analysis, which provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, 
model parameters, and model structure using probability theory.

If you are a scientist who wants to collaborate with me, a PhD student or PostDoc
candidate interested in my research, or a student looking for a thesis topic,
please [reach out to me](mailto:julius.welzel@gmail.com)!
